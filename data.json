"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was on track for a second day in the red on Friday as the bullish sentiment from the chip maker\u2019s Q4 2017 earnings report continued to wear off. Despite the early decline, AMD stock is still up from where it was before the earnings release, although the gains are in danger of being erased completely.\n\nAMD Q4 2017 earnings beat not so attractive\n\nIn a post-earnings note, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis argued that after factoring in all the \u201cmoving parts, AMD\u2019s earnings beat becomes \u201cfar less attractive.\u201d He explained that the accounting change provided a $100 million boost to AMD\u2019s Semi-Custom segment alone.\n\nHe also disagrees with management\u2019s assessment of AMD\u2019s earnings beat, noting that they mentioned\u201d incremental growth\u201d across product lines, including GPUs, and the Ryzen and EPYC product lines. Instead, he believes that most of the earnings beat came from GPUs, and most analysts agree that much of the incremental growth is coming from cryptocurrency-related demand. In fact, he doesn\u2019t think AMD management is being entirely clear on where AMD\u2019s earnings beat in Q4 came from.\n\nWas AMD management being totally clear?\n\nAlthough they estimated that about one-third of the incremental growth in the Computing and Graphics segment was probably from cryptocurrency-related demand, Curtis believes that it was probably more than that. He also noted that it\u2019s difficult to track this because the same cards are used for both gaming and cryptocurrency mining.\n\nOverall, he called the Q4 2017 results \u201cdecent,\u201d but he still believes that the main drivers of AMD\u2019s earnings beat face challenges into this year. He has \u201cseen little evidence of share gains outside of crypto,\u201d as he said that desktop CPUs are \u201cbarely up\u201d year over year. Further, he believes the chip maker\u2019s EPYC product line is \u201cunsuccessful despite a goal of mid-single-digit-unit share\u201d by the end of this year.\n\nHe feels that the new accounting standards also gave AMD\u2019s Q1 2018 guidance a boost, as the chip maker guided for sales to be $1.55 billion, plus or minus $50 million, which is beat the consensus of $1.25 billion handling. He maintains his Underweight rating and $10 price target on AMD stock following the company\u2019s earnings beat.\n\nAMD stock could be kept range-bound\n\nCredit Suisse analyst John Pitzer maintained his Neutral rating but raised his target price on AMD stock from $12 to $13.50 per share following the earnings beat. Unlike Curtis and much of the rest of the sell side, he sees crypto-related demand as being \u201cmore sustainable with most. In fact, between crypto demand and the value of the chip maker\u2019s core intellectual property, he feels the valuation of AMD stock could remain range-bound between $13 and $15 per share.\n\nLike Curtis, Macquarie analyst Srini Pajjuri questions the sustainability of crypto demand, but like Pitzer, he raised his price target for AMD stock, moving it up to $13 from $11 per share. The big thing he wants the company to work on is its margins, and he feels that the numbers suggest any share gains AMD has managed are coming from the low end of the PC and server markets. He sees servers as a key part of getting AMD stock \u201cto work,\u201d although he did find the company\u2019s progress in PCs to be \u201cencouraging.\u201d\n\nAMD stock continued to slide on Friday, falling by about 4% to as low as $9.70 before bouncing."
